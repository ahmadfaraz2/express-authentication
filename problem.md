### Problem

The problem is that we can see the user **passwords** in **plain text** because if I have **millions of users** and the password is in **plain text**, anyone of my **employees** can look at my **database** and know what the password is. Or, if a **hacker** decides to hack into my **server**, locate my **database**, then this is a pretty good **loot** for them.
